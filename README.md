# BRouter Cycling Profiles
These are [BRouter](https://brouter.de/brouter-web/) profiles I created for my personal use. I've tested these in Helsinki, Espoo, and Vantaa (in Finland) so I have no idea how these work elsewhere.

## Pleasure Profile
[Pleasure profile](pleasure.brf) focuses on safe routes that are pleasure to ride. I'm using a cyclocross bike and usually prefer routes where I have a separate bicycle lane and don't have to worry about cars. I also prefer routes where I don't have to stop in crossings and traffic lights. I don't mind riding on unpaved road as long as it is not completely crap. Quite often these decision result to a route that might not be the shortest, but it is easy to ride and quite often it is relatively fast too.
